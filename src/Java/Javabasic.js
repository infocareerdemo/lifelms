        <br></br>

        1.     Game Development
        Many popular mobile, computer, and video games are built in Java. Even modern games that integrate advanced technology like machine learning or virtual reality are built with Java technology.
        <br></br>
        2.     Cloud computing
        Java is often referred to as WORA – Write Once and Run Anywhere, making it perfect for decentralized cloud-based applications. Cloud providers choose Java language to run programs on a wide range of underlying platforms.
        <br></br>
        3.     Big Data
        Java is used for data processing engines that can work with complex data sets and massive amounts of real-time data.
        <br></br>
        4.     Artificial Intelligence
        Java is a powerhouse of machine learning libraries. Its stability and speed make it perfect for artificial intelligence application development like natural language processing and deep learning.
        <br></br>
        5.     Internet of Things
        Java has been used to program sensors and hardware in edge devices that can connect independently to the internet.
